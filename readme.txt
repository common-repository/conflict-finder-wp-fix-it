This is the easiest and fastest way to see if you have a conflict on your site. All changes for admin view only.
== Description ==
This is the easiest and fastest way to see if you have a conflict on your site. Disable all active plugins with a single click. You can also turn them all back on with a single click without losing any settings or functionality. You can also enable WP_DEBUG directly from your admin area with no need for FTP or server access. WordPress WP_DEBUG is a built-in debugging tool that when enabled, will display any PHP errors on the front end of your site.
The best part is this is only for the admin user. That means all other users will not see any errors or loss of functions with a plugin being off. So fast and easy to know instantly if there is a plugin conflict on your site causing an issue.
There is an option where you can enter the URL of the place where you are seeing an issue and this will preview on the options page so as you go through and deactivate plugins the preview will update and you can find which plugin is the culprit.
== SUPER HERO FEATURE ==
In the event that there is a fatal error on your website and you get a website visitor, they will not see the error message but instead they will see a pretty page instead of the default WordPress error page.
